		<h5>Message from our Board and Staff</h5>
		<h2><strong>Bike &amp; Build 2013:</strong> <em>A Thousand Communities</em></h2>

		<p class="intro">A rider from Spokane, Washington. A host in Natchitoches, Louisiana. A build partner in “The Little Apple,” Manhattan, Kansas. A grantee in “The Big Apple,” New York City. Bike &amp; Build’s reach in 2013 was vast and deep, impacting people across the country in rural and urban settings, across cultures and demographics. Our ten routes move from town to town across the United States with one purpose: engaging young adults in service for the affordable housing cause. </p>

		<p>Our trips, composed of 30 strangers, become their own communities. Through highs and lows, headwinds and rain, the bonds that develop are powerful and awakening and create an additional level of meaning for our young adults. But beyond that internal microcosm, each team interacts with communities and their members on a level that creates an awareness and appreciation - on both sides of that interaction - of a community different from your own. A Thousand Communities mutually reached, impacted, and empowered.</p>

		<p>Over 250 riders, ages 18-25 and teeming with idealism and energy, met on the East Coast for Bike &amp; Build’s 2013 routes. Pedaling thousands of miles, these young adults touched almost 500 churches, community centers, and schools who graciously hosted our teams. Their generosity not only sustained us calorically and socially, but allowed us to financially support affordable housing organizations in roughly 250 cities and towns through our grant program. A Thousand Communities, connected and supporting each other.</p>

		<p>Collecting and redirecting donations to our affordable housing partners is an incredibly important, measurable, and cogent part of our program, but our reach extends into tangible and intangible realms that go beyond standard metrics. In this report, we feature 2013 riders who will be service advocates far longer than their B&amp;B summer; alumni who continue to make a difference; grant partners who are making the most of the funds they receive from Bike &amp; Build; community hosts who make our rides possible; and the sponsors that support our programs. </p>

		<p>We are grateful to each and every community that supports Bike &amp; Build and are proud of the impact that we had in 2013. We invite you learn more about how to Bike &amp; Build and how your town can be a part of Bike &amp; Build’s Thousand Communities.</p>

		<h2>Bike &amp; Build Scholarship</h2>
		<p class="intro">Many young adults in the U.S. have the motivation to serve their communities but do not have the means. These are individuals who have lived the affordable housing crisis. In 2013, Bike &amp; Build set out to engage a young person in our rides who without financial support would not have been able to participate. Thanks to the generosity of donors, we exceeded our goal and awarded two Bike &amp; Build Scholarships!</p>

		<p>The Bike &amp; Build Scholarship increases access to our trips for young adults from at-risk backgrounds in our hometown of Philadelphia. It supports those who might not otherwise have this life-changing opportunity. Our two 2013 recipients, Da’Quan Tucker (full scholarship) and Daniel Farmer (half scholarship), were selected because of their compelling stories and interest in supporting affordable housing.</p> 
		
		<ul class="clearfix" id="recipients">
			<li>
				<img src="img/content/06scholarship/daquan.jpg" alt="Da’Quan on The Capital Ride"/>
				<strong> Da’Quan Tucker </strong> <br>
				(full scholarship)
			</li>
			<li>
				<img src="img/content/06scholarship/daniel.jpg" alt="Daniel on The Capital Ride"/>
				<strong> Daniel Farmer </strong> <br>
				(half scholarship)
			</li>
			
		</ul>

		<p>Da’Quan, Daniel, and their teammates pedaled 556 miles from Richmond, VA to Philadelphia as part of The Capital Ride in July. They cumulatively volunteered 312 build hours with 4 affordable housing orgs, advocated for the cause in 9 host communities, and raised $22,455.11 to support Bike &amp; Build and Rebuilding Together Philadelphia.</p>

		<blockquote>Bike &amp; Build gave me a personal perspective of how the affordable housing cause affects communities outside of my own,” Da’Quan said afterwards. “It also made me realize that I can do something about it. It’s inspiring to serve others and be a part of the solution.” <small>  <span class="quoteauth">Da'Quan Tucker</span> <span class="authnote">Da’Quan recently enlisted in the Navy, but hopes to lead a Bike &amp; Build trip one day.</span> </small> </blockquote>
		

		<p>This summer, scholarship recipients will participate in <a href="http://coastaldrift.org"target=_blank>Coastal Drift,</a> Bike &amp; Build’s inaugural ride from Bar Harbor, ME to New York City. Coastal Drift offers the Bike &amp; Build experience condensed into a three week period. Daniel, now a freshman at the University of Delaware, spoke of the value of the experience. “You aren’t just sitting back and talking about helping others. You are actually doing it.” Learn more at <a href="http://coastaldrift.org"target=_blank>coastaldrift.org.</a></p>

					<h2>Antelope Valley YouthBuild</h2>
					<h5>Palmdale, CA - $10,000</h5>
					<p class="intro">In 2012 and 2013, Bike &amp; Builders volunteered on a project in the desert of Palmdale that stuck with many of our riders, so much so that 2013’s ME2SB team fully funded their grant. AV YouthBuild is refurbishing a property that will create units for up to 19 young adults in need of homes. Residents will either be current students in the YouthBuild program or recent graduates, particularly single mothers with children under the age of five.</p> 
				  </header>
				  </div>
				  <section class="content">
				<p>AV YouthBuild supports about 170 young people in Palmdale each year by working with them to obtain their high school diploma and various professional credentials while concurrently learning valuable job and leadership skills. Students spend half of their time in the classroom and half on jobsites developing skills in construction, nursing, solar energy production, and fire-fighting. The supportive housing facility will be rent-free, provided tenants maintain positive success in school or their career. When finished, the building will make AV YouthBuild the only YB program in the country with an accompanying housing unit. The facility is part of a long-term “adopt-a-block” strategy, where AV YouthBuild will work on reinvigorating the entire neighborhood, block-by-block. Next year, Bike &amp; Build can look forward to working on a duplex home for local low-income families.</p> 

				<p>One of aspects that drew Bike &amp; Build riders to AV YouthBuild was the chance they got to interact directly with the YB students on the build site. AV YouthBuild Executive Director Rossie Johnson agreed. “The Bike &amp; Builders are the same age as our YouthBuild students, so it’s a great exchange between the groups. It’s a great way for our students to see other young people ‘paying it forward,’ and I know the B&Bers really enjoy working with our group.”</p>

					<h2>Habitat for Humanity Portland/Metro East</h2>
					<h5>Portland, OR - $10,000</h5>
					<p class="intro">Habitat for Humanity Portland/Metro East, engages middle and high school-aged students in their Youth United program. In 2013, they received Bike &amp; Build funds from the Central US route to support the building of a home compliant to Earth Advantage Platinum standards. This home will be the third sponsored by the Youth United program over the last five years, where students have taken an active role in the planning, fundraising, and construction of the home. By raising funds to achieve the Earth Advantage designation, Habitat for Humanity Portland/Metro East is increasing the value of the home now and in the future for its future owners: heating bills can be exorbitant for low-income residents, and future environmental features will enhance the home’s value in the decades to come. The students working on the home are gaining valuable knowledge a range of technical subjects as well.</p>
					</header>
					</div>
				<section class="content">
				<p>“It’s a great group of kids from a diverse range of backgrounds that we work with,” said Tor Ostrom, Director of Volunteer Programs and Corporate Engagement. “Many of them use Youth United as a stepping stone to other service work. They are becoming advocates for the affordable housing cause because we engage them in their formative years.” The partnership with Bike &amp; Build is a natural fit. “Portland had a huge biking culture and many active young adults. Our Youth United kids are really excited about Bike &amp; Build too, it’s inspired them and that will carry forward.” </p>

				<h2>Youth Rebuilding New Orleans</h2>
				<h5>New Orleans, LA - $8,350 </h5>
				<p class="intro">Almost ten years after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, there is still a tremendous need for housing for residents of the Big Easy. Youth Rebuilding New Orleans is using the city’s young adults and volunteers for Project HOMEwork, which builds homes for teachers in the area. With such a large need for teachers in New Orleans, Project HOMEwork aims to attract educators to the city to fill this need. “We had the volunteers in our youth, and this became a holistic way to address a serious long-term need for our students,” explained Executive Director William Stoudt.</p>
				</header>
				</div>
				<section class="content">
				<p>YRNO’s volunteers come ready to work, but without the tools to get something done, that energy is for naught. Thus, a large portion of the grant to YRNO from B&B’s Southern route will replenish their tool inventory, maximizing volunteer capacity. Other parts of the B&B grant will go to hiring young people who had previously dropped out of high school and are now pursuing their GED. YRNO is training these individuals as site supervisors for the organization’s volunteers. </p>

				<p>The organization’s culture is defined by their young people. Between site supervisors and office staff, YRNO’s average employee age is 22 years old. Much like Bike &amp; Build, the idealism and energy of its young people drives the organization. </p>

				<h2>Pikes Peak Habitat for Humanity</h2>
				<h5>Colorado Springs, CO - $55,000</h5>
				<p class="intro">For the last five summers, Pikes Peak Habitat for Humanity has served as a pre-arranged grant beneficiary for their support of two of our routes, NC2SD and SC2SC. Since the formation of SC2SC in 2009, Pikes Peak has hosted a blitz build with our riders, where Bike &amp; Build riders build as much as possible of a single home. This year, B&B helped construct the Kleine home. </p>
				</header>
				</div>
				<section class="content">
				<p>“Getting the house is the biggest thing that has ever happened to our family, but working with Bike &amp; Build was a thousand times better,” said Karen Kleine. “The house is just a house, but Bike &amp; Build made it a home.” Karen, her husband Scott, and their four children are planning to finally move in to their home in 2014. The family spent time with both B&B routes on-site. “The first day when I went home, my cheeks hurt from smiling. It was such a treat to hear these young adults talk about what they are doing with their life after the summer. They are going to make a big difference.”</p>

				<p>Since 2009, Bike &amp; Build has granted over $278,000 to Pikes Peak Habitat, through annual donations that have allowed Bike &amp; Build to put a significant stamp on five homes in the Colorado Springs area.  “It’s amazing to see how much work can be done in a short week’s time,” Andy Petersen, Pikes Peak Habitat’s Development Director, said of Bike &amp; Build riders.  “They are all over the place doing all sorts of different things.” The weeklong stay for the SC route becomes quite the community undertaking as well, so Pikes Peak Habitat helps B&B trip leaders coordinate their stay with a local church and brings in three meals per day. It’s that effort that will allow the Kleine’s to enjoy the dinner table that they haven’t had for lack of space in their current home. “The biggest thing I’m looking forward to is seeing our kids make their rooms their own. They’re really excited about being able to have their friends over.”</p>

				<h2>Thank You to Our Hosts</h2>
				<p class="intro">
				Without the nearly 500 separate churches, schools, and community centers that welcomed Bike &amp; Build into their communities in 2013, our trips would have never departed the Atlantic Coast.</p>
			</header>
			<article>
				
		
				<p>To maximize the funds we can donate to affordable housing organizations, we seek out overnight hosts that will provide us with shelter, dinner and breakfast, and showers for our riders. 30 individuals with gear and bikes, plus a large support van and trailer, can be quite the undertaking for a congregation or community center. (Not to mention the thousands of calories Bike &amp; Builders tend to consume each meal.) </p>

				Bike &amp; Build uses these host interactions to advocate for the affordable housing cause, offering dinner presentations each night. We also provide community bike clinics for local children, where our riders work with youngsters on how to bike safely in their neighborhood. And we provide each host the opportunity to designate an affordable housing nonprofit of their choice to receive a $100 donation from Bike &amp; Build as a thank you. But really, the reason these communities host Bike &amp; Build is out of pure generosity. We are truly grateful for their support! </p>

				If you see that Bike &amp; Build is coming into your community (check out our route maps and overnight locations), please contact <a href="mailto:overnights@bikeandbuild.org"target=_blank>overnights@bikeandbuild.org</a> to be involved. Our Trip Leaders begin solidifying our host locations in the early spring; even if it’s nothing more than stopping by to learn more about Bike &amp; Build, we’d love to hear from you!

			<h2>Rider Spotlights</h2>

			<p class="intro">286 riders participated in Bike &amp; Build in 2013, coming from all across the country. Their numerous backgrounds and interests meshed into single units, with each trip supporting hundreds communities as they pedaled west.  Many of our riders commit to continuing their service long after Bike &amp; Build is complete. These stories of service are but a few of the many that former Bike &amp; Build riders pursue every year. </p>

					<small>Kristin Anderson has worked for North Shore Community Development Coalition in Salem, MA for four years, now serving as the Director of Community Development. This summer, she took a sabbatical as a trip leader on ME2SB13. One of ME2SB’s riders, Melissa Panter, now serves as an AmeriCorps member with North Shore CDC after Kristin connected her to the organization. Now the B&B teammates work together to provide low-income residents with quality, affordable housing and community programs to support those individuals and families.</small></aside>

				<p> <strong>Why did you guys apply to Bike &amp; Build?</strong></p>
				<p><span class="speaker">KA</span> North Shore actually had a volunteer who was meeting her sweat equity for Bike &amp; Build with us last year, so she began telling me about it. I was immediately drawn to it because I’ve always had this dream of biking across the United States. It combined all these things I was passionate about, between biking, working with young adults, service-learning, affordable housing, and put it all in experience. It felt like something I would be crazy not to do.</p>
				<p><span class="speaker">MP</span> I heard about it from a friend too. She had done it about four years ago, so it was always in the back of my mind through college. I did some work with housing projects in college, so that really helped convince me to sign up.</p>

				<p> <strong>What were some of your favorite experiences from the trip?</strong></p>
				<p><span class="speaker">MP</span> Oh, gosh. It’s so tough to choose! Going through the Mojave Desert towards the end of the trip was neat because you realized that something that was basically unimaginable just a few months ago was now routine. Just seeing how much everybody had changed since the start of the trip was so cool. </p>
				<p><span class="speaker">KA</span> We got to see so many different affordable housing organizations on the trip. That range was really valuable to see what diverse models exist to address the issue. And at most build sites we got to meet the future homeowners. Early in the trip we worked on a home that was going to be the first in that neighborhood that was accessible to a wheelchair, and we got to meet the woman who was moving in. Talking to her and learning how valuable that ramp was going to be to her was amazing.</p>

				<p> <strong>Describe the relationships you developed on the trip.</strong></p>
				<p><span class="speaker">KA</span> All of a sudden you have this incredible network of people in your life, all aligned with the same values. And it’s not just riders, but hosts, families that would provide meals, organizations that let us do work for them, even though they had to put a lot of energy into coordinating us… These are all people who no matter where they came from all came together around this cause. Everybody values that spirit of going on this adventure to do that work.</p>
				<p><span class="speaker">MP</span> I can count on my teammates for anything. And with our host sites, the warmth and caring that each site gave us was above and beyond what we deserved. They basically treated us like kings! </p>

				<p> <strong>What’s it like to work with each other, post-B&B?</strong></p>
				<p><span class="speaker">MP</span> Being able to see Kristin every day at work has really helped with the transition to real world! We both understand each other’s struggles with not being on the road anymore. On the trip we called Kristin ‘Mom’. She was our rock and coming back into the real world she is still my rock that keeps Bike &amp; Build fresh.</p>
				<p><span class="speaker">KA</span> I love working with Melissa. It’s nice to have somebody who really gets what North Shore is doing, carrying on the energy and spirit of Bike &amp; Build in this office. And she’s right, it’s great to have somebody to reminisce with too! </p>

						<small>After Bike &amp; Build, Zoe began an AmeriCorps term with Habitat for Humanity of Charlotte in North Carolina. She is also an AmeriCorps*NCCC alum, having served several years ago out of the Vicksburg, MS campus doing Hurricane Katrina recovery in the Gulf Coast.</small></aside> 

					<p> <strong>What drew you to Bike &amp; Build?</strong></p>
					<p>I heard about it when I was 19 and wanted to do it from that moment. Before I applied last year I spent a full afternoon watching Bike &amp; Build videos on YouTube and felt like I needed to be a part of that adventure. I knew I wanted to do more work with Habitat for Humanity, so this this was going to be a great way to experience many different affiliates around the country. I wanted to see what other organizations were doing and become more knowledgeable myself.</p>

					<p> <strong>Did you have a favorite build day during the trip?</strong></p>
					<p>Our build with Flatirons Habitat just outside of Boulder, CO was awesome. The supervisor we were working with made a huge effort educate us about their affiliate and the impact they were having in the community. At lunch and throughout the day he talked about the economic realities for low-income families living in the Denver and Boulder area, where the cost of living can be really high. We ended up giving them one of our grants because they did such a good job connecting us with the cause, and we really felt well-versed in their local issues when we finished that day.</p>

					<p> <strong>What are you up to now with Habitat Charlotte?</strong></p>
					<p>I’m leading volunteer groups and doing construction on-site. I leap out of bed every day. I can’t wait to get up and go to work. There is such a high output for my time effort. Somebody is getting a home because of what we are doing. Being about to work with them is amazing.</p>

			<h2>Alumni Spotlights</h2>

			<p class="intro">After 11 summers, the Bike &amp; Build alumni network is now over 2,000-strong. Some former riders spoke about the impact Bike &amp; Build had on them, and how they are staying involved in their community. They are represented by a 13-member Alumni Council, made up of former riders from across the country. </p>

			<p>The Bike &amp; Build Alumni Council engages riders in our cause long after they complete a trip. The 2013 Council, led by Kyle Magida (SUS06, B2SB08) and David Neirenberg (SUS05), expanded to 13 members and undertook numerous projects. The Council is the voice of our 2,000+ member network. Alums, learn how to be involved <a href="http://www.bikeandbuild.org/cms/content/view/9204/393/"target=_blank>in the Council here.</a></p>
			
			<h4>In 2013, The Alumni Council accomplished the following:</h4>
			<ul> 
				<li>	Granting $10,000 in emergency funds to organizations addressing the disasters from Superstorm Sandy, the tornadoes in Oklahoma, and the floods in Colorado. </li>
				<li>	Organizing a fundraising campaign to support the Bike &amp; Build Scholarship. Alumni funded the partial scholarship for Daniel’s bike in 2013, and has set a goal to fund a full scholarship in 2014! </li>
				<li>	Operating a mentoring program between alumni and new riders. </li>
				<li>	Carrying out numerous recruitment activities to spread the word about Bike &amp; Build to future riders.</li>

  					<img class="perfect-circle" src="img/content/10alumni/katy.jpg" alt="Katy">
  					<small>Katy is Bike &amp; Build’s 2013 Chris Webber Memorial Fund Fellow. Her fellowship supports her investigation into the strategy many international organizations are employing to fund affordable housing initiatives through microcredit lending, and how they can be applied to alleviate the high housing costs in Pittsburgh, Katy’s hometown. The fellowship will take her research to Nicaragua in 2014.</small></aside>

  				<p><strong>How is your project coming? Interesting findings?</strong></p> 
  				<p>It’s been great so far. I’ve met so many people that are excited to try new strategies to expand affordable housing options in Pittsburgh. There’s already a lot more going on that what I realized, but there is a tremendous need for alternative ways to work for housing provisions. Pittsburgh is a unique case. It has seen a significant population decline in the recent decades, so there are plenty of homes in the area. However, many of them are unaffordable or falling apart. Microcredit is one possibility for addressing that. That’s why Nicaragua is such an interesting place. There are many organizations down there, both housing and non, that succeed using microcredit. The goal is to learn what makes those projects work and implement the strategies in Pittsburgh.</p>

  				<p><strong>Explain how microcredit works?</strong></p>
  				<p>For purposes of this project, a funder will make a small loan to a low-income homeowner to rehabilitate a home in need of repair. These homeowners generally lack the ability to obtain a traditional loan from a financial institution, so microcredit provides a smaller loan at a very low-to-no interest rate. The goal is to foster success within the individual obtaining the loan, and once they are established in their home, they have a base with which to obtain employment, jumpstart their children’s education, live healthier lives, and become engaged citizens. The capital that they’ll produce will be more than enough to pay back the microfinancing they received.</p> 

  				<strong>What prompted you to apply for a CWM Fellowship?</strong>
  				<p>After my Bike &amp; Build trip in 2010 I did a year of AmeriCorps service with Sussex County Habitat for Humanity in Delaware. I worked to help them start their Brush with Kindness program, which provides home repairs for low-income residents. I loved serving with Habitat, but it inspired me to look at alternative ways to provide housing besides just volunteering to build new houses. So many organizations struggle with money and fundraising, so this could be a sustainable way to provide new resources. </p>

  				<p><strong>What’s your ultimate career goal? Do you want to keep working in the affordable housing field?</strong></p>
  				<p>Once this project is complete, I’m looking at going to grad school for public policy and management. I’d like to keep working on housing issues. I love Pittsburgh and I want to be able to help it from within! That was the great thing about Bike &amp; Build. It helped me realize that I’m capable of a lot more than I thought, both physically and emotionally. That’s created a mindset that filters into the rest of my life.</p>

					<h3>Erin Kinneen</h3>
					<h4>Providence to Seattle ’04 – Seattle, WA</h4>
				 
				  <section class="content">		
				<aside class="clearfix">
					<img class="perfect-circle" src="img/content/10alumni/erin.jpg" alt="Erin">
					<small>2013 was Erin’s first year on the Bike &amp; Build Alumni Council. She quickly became one of the Council’s most active members, spearheading the $10,000 Alumni Council Emergency Grant Program and co-leading the Alumni Mentoring Program.</small></aside>

				<p><strong>Erin… what the heck are you up to right now?</strong></p>
				<p>I work as a physical therapist at an out-patient clinic. We work with people dealing with a variety of medical issues, including joint, back, and knee pain. We also work with those suffering from more serious ailments, like burn victims and traumatic injuries. It’d be great to get into teaching on the university level someday too. Ultimately, I want to be able to help people stay active and do what they love to do.</p>

				<p><strong>Your Bike &amp; Build trip was nine summers ago. What keeps you connected to B&amp;B almost a decade later?</strong></p>
				<p>I’m originally from the Boston area, so Bike &amp; Build gave me a chance to explore so many new places out West. And honestly, it’s with me as a daily reminder because Bike &amp; Build brought me to Seattle. I get to connect with P2S every year when they arrive at the end of their trip, so it’s a thrill to see how they’ve grown so close throughout the summer. And every year I get to see how Bike &amp; Build evolves to be better and stronger. So being on the Alumni Council allows me to give back to something that significantly changed my life.</p> 

				<p><strong>What are some more things you’d like to accomplish with the Alumni Council?</strong></p>
				<p>I want to continue helping to educate new riders. We have such a good network now, so I’d like to help see it grow and thrive. Personally, I’ve been practicing physical therapy for eight years now, so I’d like to serve as a resource for younger riders who might want to get involved in PT as a career.</p>

Each trip is tracked through the <a href="http://www.bikeandbuild.org/cms/content/view/109/230/"target=_blank>“Route Tracker,”</a> which logs daily mileage, host sites, and official journal entries. Additionally, many riders blog throughout the journey; these also are accessible through the Bike &amp; Build website.</p>
	
				<h3> Support Affordable Housing in Your Community</h3>
				<p>Bike &amp; Builders inspire the many community members we meet to invest in improving this country’s affordable housing accessibility. Do you know of an organization in your community that could benefit from a Bike &amp; Build grant? Send them to our website and encourage them to apply this summer. You can also take action; simply call up your local affiliate and volunteer!</p>
		
				<h3> Spread the Word!</h3>
				<p>Much of Bike &amp; Build’s recruitment comes from word-of-mouth. Our alumni and community hosts are our most effective recruiters for future riders. If you know a young adult who would benefit from a Bike &amp; Build summer, send them to <a href="http://bikeandbuild.org"target=_blank>bikeandbuild.org</a>. </p>
